# Balatro Mongolian Localisation Project

Individual project on translating and localising Balatro into Mongolian language. Meant to be made on my own, with significant changes, but any help or uggestions are welcome.

*Learn more about Balatro on [playbalatro.com](https://www.playbalatro.com/), and buy it to support its creator! Highly recommended, fun indie games like this is rare tho!*

## How to install this mod tho? ?

I'll figure it out when I'm ready I guess. It's moreso for my personal use, so I might slog down in terms of releasing it to public.

### Translations

✅ v0.0.1. Groundworks have begun. No significant translations have been done yet.

## Contributing

Forked from very popular French localisation mod, as it was very lackluster in the original game. Easy to look over tho, it is an indie game, and localisation is not the highest priority. Even bigger games like fucking Elden Ring uses Google Translate to get to the end of it, so makes sense for the game to have a subpar translation where the community may want to change it for the better. Only problem I personally have would be the fact that the game is NOT welcoming for translations, like, say, Papers Please, but again, too much to ask from a small company tbh.
